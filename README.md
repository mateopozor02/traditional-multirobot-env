# Multi-Robot Simulation Environment (Traditional Navi-Stack)
This repository contains the necessary elements to launch and run a multi-robot 
simulation environment in Gazebo using traditional navigation methods provided by the 
ROS Navigation Stack. 

The environment is configured to launch three robots, although this can be further 
extended. One of the robots uses A* as the global planner, and the two other robots 
user Dijkstra.
